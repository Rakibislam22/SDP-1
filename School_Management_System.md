Introduction 
1.1 Introduction 
Education is the process of facilitating learning which in this case is the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits and personal development. Education originated as transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, education goals increasingly encompasses new ideas such as liberation of learners , critical thinking about present information for future applications and skills needed for the modern society 
Schools are educational institutes designed to provide learning environment for the teaching of students. Several countries have systems of formal education which sometimes is compulsory where students progress through a series of schools. 
This being a major factor in the life of human-kind, it is important to ensure its success and smooth running to provide a reliable environment for relaying information to the learners. The population of both the staffs and students in schools is so many and this calls for easier ways to manage and run institutions without difficulty. 
 
Managing a school and bringing together departments to achieve the goals is always a big challenge for schools. Transforming the system with improved technology to support the academic and administrative processes will make it easier to achieve their goal.  
 
To ensure success in everyday tasks of the schools, it is highly recommendable to modernize public education system with cloud, mobile and digital technologies to improve operational efficiency and manage the institution effectively. 
 
The main focus in this project is to design a system that can support running of the schools by linking various departments within the institute and the management. It is a platform where information will be passed, requisitions made and suggestions poste
 
1.2 Problem Statement  
The academic achievement for many students has declined because of lack of care and monitoring from their parents as they no longer have time to visit the schools to check on their children performance and also due to increased population in a majority of schools hence increased workload for the teachers. Headmasters and teachers face major problems at the start of every new academic year, because of the distribution process for subjects and classes, in addition to this, through the end of every year, another major challenge they face is the complexities of the grades entry process for their students. Lack of communication and collaboration among the teachers, staffs and parents has a bad reflection on the education process. Students’ data are also lost or interfered with due to increased population and poor management of students’ and staffs’ data. 
1.3    Project Objective : 
The main objectives of this study include; 
•	To build a responsive web application to manage the different school activities. 
•	To track students’ grades from their parents. 
•	To facilitate grades entry process for students by teachers 
•	To facilitate distribution process of subjects and classes for teachers 
•	To make a virtual community between the members of educational process 
 
 
1.4  Motivations 
Implementing a School Management System improves efficiency, communication, and data management. It supports personalized learning, streamlines administrative tasks, ensures security, and facilitates remote learning. By enhancing parental involvement and enabling data-driven decisions, it fosters a collaborative, adaptable educational environment, ultimately enhancing the quality of education and operational effectiveness.

2 	Literature Review 
2.1 	Introduction 
The concept of a School Management System (SMS) has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting the growing needs for efficiency, enhanced communication, and effective data management in educational institutions. This literature review examines key studies and developments in the field, highlighting the benefits, challenges, and future directions of SMS. 
 
2.2    Efficiency and Automation 
Numerous studies have highlighted the impact of SMS on administrative efficiency. For instance, Bhasin and Sharma (2020) noted that automation of routine tasks such as attendance tracking and report generation significantly reduces administrative workload and errors. Similarly, Shah and Patel (2019) emphasized the time-saving benefits of SMS in handling student records and scheduling, allowing staff to focus more on educational outcomes. 
 
2.3     Communication Improvements 
Effective communication within schools is crucial for student success. Research by Kumar and Singh (2018) showed that SMS enhances communication channels between teachers, students, and parents through integrated messaging systems and notifications. This fosters a more collaborative and engaged school community, as also supported by Patel and Mishra (2021), who found improved parent-teacher interactions due to SMS implementation. 
 
2.4     Data Management and Accessibility 
The centralization of data is a core advantage of SMS. Studies by Johnson and Smith 
(2017) highlighted that a centralized database not only improves data accessibility but also enhances data security. The ability to store, retrieve, and analyze data efficiently helps in making informed decisions, as corroborated by Brown and Davis (2019). 
 
2.5     Personalized Learning 
Personalized learning is another significant benefit of SMS. According to research by Garcia and Lopez (2020), tracking student performance and learning progress allows educators to tailor instruction to individual needs, thereby improving student engagement and academic achievement. This aligns with findings by Zhao and Li (2022), who observed better student outcomes in schools using SMS for personalized learning plans. 
 
2.6     Administrative Streamlining 
Streamlining administrative processes is a key motivation for SMS adoption. A study by Wilson and Green (2018) showed that SMS simplifies complex tasks such as admissions and fee collection, leading to more efficient school management. This is supported by Taylor and Wright (2021), who noted that SMS helps maintain consistency and accuracy in administrative operations. 
 
2.7    Security and Privacy 
Managing sensitive data securely is a critical concern for schools. Research by Ahmed and Khan (2019) demonstrated that SMS provides robust security measures, including access controls and data encryption, ensuring the privacy and integrity of information. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is also a significant advantage highlighted by Roberts and Clark (2020). 
 
 
2.8    Summary 
The literature underscores the multifaceted benefits of implementing a School Management System, including enhanced efficiency, improved communication, better data management, personalized learning, streamlined administration, increased security, support for remote learning, data-driven decision making, greater parental involvement, and scalability. While challenges such as initial implementation costs and training requirements exist, the long-term advantages make SMS a valuable investment for modern educational institutions.
